# TeXMathBoard

This is a simple Java application designed to quickly draft math content, such as equations, special symbols, etc.

It's inspired in [GeoGebra Text tool](https://www.geogebra.org) and uses the same [library to render LaTeX code](https://github.com/opencollab/jlatexmath).

## Features

* Key strokes to insert the most common used constructions, such as fractions, nth-root and matrices
* Font size and color control
* The resulting LaTeX content can be either copied to clipboard or exported as PNG

Inside the screen, you can click on *Code* and *Result* labels to see more information about how to access each feature.

# Licence

This program is free to use, modify and distribute (after all, it uses a free library as the main feature), as long as you include the LICENCE file and this repository link as part of your distribution.
